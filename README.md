Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Airbnb data  

What did we learn from this project?

a). We found that Entre home/apt has the highest number of room types overall and prices are high in Brooklyn and Manhattan for the entire home/apt.

b). From visualization most people love to stay in the entire home/apt and in a private room rather than a shared room.

c). Most of people like to stay at a lower price and their reviews are higher in that area.

d). We have found the busiest host.

e). They are busy because they listed their room type as entire home/apt and private room which is preferred by most people .

f). We found the traffic area based on the minimum nights booked.

g). At last we found a correlation between the variables.
